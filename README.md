# Vehicle Parking System

Welcome to the Vehicle Parking System project! This system is designed to efficiently detect and manage car parking within predefined parking spots in a given video stream using advanced image processing techniques.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a car parking detection system using Python, OpenCV, and various image processing techniques. The system identifies parked cars within predefined parking spots and provides real-time updates on the availability of parking spaces.

## Features

- **Accurate Detection**: Efficiently identifies parked cars in predefined parking spots within a given video stream.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a high level of accuracy through a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline, including adaptive thresholding, median blur, and dilation.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Incorporates position-specific contour counting to provide real-time updates on the availability of parking spaces.
- **Improved Parking Management**: Contributes to improved parking management by providing accurate and timely information on parking space occupancy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Image Processing Techniques

## How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: The system preprocesses the video stream using techniques such as adaptive thresholding, median blur, and dilation to enhance image quality.
2. **Detection**: Identifies and counts contours specific to parked cars within predefined parking spots.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Provides real-time updates on parking space availability based on the detected contours.
